                <p>Hi Asha,</p>
                <p>I love hearing your mind. You have a different and bold view on things. Not only that, but you give explanations of why you think that way. I don’t always agree with you, but I still love hearing what you have to say. It allows me to consider things I didn’t think about before and decide how I feel about something.  You make a question my why.</p>
                <p>My favorite part is the journey. You take me on a journey of "no return" which is empowering. No return to the world as I knew it! I love traveling “with you.” It triggers thoughts within me. You challenge my views of the world, which makes me a better human.</p>

                <p>GREAT job and I 100% agree with your amazing, up front and very clear view /description of what happened to you and what kind of nonsense people say to allow compromise with the subject you covered in "Breaking Silence".</p>
                <p>Brave stance!  Thank you for standing up for what's right.  Unless you go with the followers of culture, rather than a leader for truth, mercy and justice, you will be opposed.</p>

                <p>Hi Asha,</p>
                <p>Your strong thoughts seem at odds with what one would expect given your cultural background and where you grew up. It’s a dichotomy that makes your voice even more interesting. There is no female passivity with you. </p>
                <p>I value that you have a very strong poignant voice. And you always back it up. You are a good example and role model for how to speak candidly.

                <p>When we went to the restaurant, you shared passionately about the impact plastics are having on our oceans and wildlife while respecting my choice to use a straw. However, since then, I’ve been noticing more articles about plastics online and have been rethinking my use of straws. </p>

                <p>Believe me when I say that you really shifted my perspective this last week. I had been complaining to girlfriends about being single “forever” and never being able to find “him,” and blah blah blah. And like a badass, your blog (You Complete Me) swooped right in when I was feeling most self-pitying with the reminder that who cares, today is all I’m guaranteed anyway, and I am enough.</p>

              <p>Wow! Wow again! Usually I don’t care too much about pictures. I prefer my mental, personal photomap. But your "Uganda-album"... it really touched me!!! The human like emotions on the great apes, the hand on the bars, and the million things YOU see (but actually don’t see) every day: a man a woman, a vern, a goat or a rooster. You made them come alive!!!

                <p>Then I read your blogs and I remember that there are people who care -- about animals and people -- and the future of our planet. Your voice amplifies mine, and for that, I say thank you. Your voice is crucial as we attempt to break through the darkness. Your passion is deep. Your eloquence is refreshing and edgy, and most importantly, you are helping us all look in the mirror. </p>

                <p>Thanks for creating thought provoking art that’s defined, and yet, open for interpretation. Your work makes me stop, look at what you put in front of me and ask myself – what am I doing? Do I need to do something different? When I read your blog, I can feel it. That’s impactful!</p>
                <p>Your podcast on divorce made me understand that I need to take care of myself. I was too busy trying to be a martyr for others and neglected to take care of myself for years. And your article “You complete me” screamed at me saying - Get off your ass and do something about it! I learned that I am responsible for my own happiness. I’ve made changes to my life and am working my way to being more happy thanks to your work. </p>

I just had a long talk with my husband about the saying "boys will be boys” and how insidious it is. Of course he claimed that I needed to take it all in context and understand that moms use it very innocently, but I was adamant that he didn't understand how that perpetuates this entire culture around men having no responsibility to control themselves. </p>
