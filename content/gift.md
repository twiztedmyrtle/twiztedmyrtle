            <p>Hi Asha,</p>
            <p>
              I love hearing your mind. You have a different and bold view on things. Not only that, but you give explanations of why you think that way. I don’t always agree with you, but I still love hearing what you have to say. It allows me to consider things I didn’t think about before and decide how I feel about something.  You make a question my why.
            </p>
            <p>
              My favorite part is the journey. You take me on a journey of "no return" which is empowering. No return to the world as I knew it! I love traveling “with you.” It triggers thoughts within me. You challenge my views of the world, which makes me a better human.

            <p>Hi Asha,</p>
            <p>
              As strong as your thoughts are, they seem at odds with what one would expect given your cultural background and where you grew up. It’s a dichotomy that makes your voice even more interesting. There is no female passivity with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I value that you have a very strong poignant voice; and you always back it up. You are a good example and role model. I would like to be more like you. I would like to speak my mind more and be more candid like you.

            <p>Hallo Asha,</p>
            <p>Wow! Wow again! Usually I don’t care too much about pictures. I prefer my mental, personal photomap. But your "Uganda-album"... it really touched me!!! The human like emotions on the great apes, the hand on the bars, and the million things YOU see (but actually don’t see) every day: a man a woman, a vern, a goat or a rooster. You made them come alive!!!

            Thanks for sharing sister!

              PS—I love the title Twizted Trophies, and I’ve never (until now) thought of it like the way you put it: writing “Save Trees” on chopped up trees!
