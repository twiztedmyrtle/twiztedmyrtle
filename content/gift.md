                <p>Hi Asha,</p>
                <p>I love hearing your mind. You have a different and bold view on things. Not only that, but you give explanations of why you think that way. I don’t always agree with you, but I still love hearing what you have to say. It allows me to consider things I didn’t think about before and decide how I feel about something.  You make a question my why.</p>
                <p>My favorite part is the journey. You take me on a journey of "no return" which is empowering. No return to the world as I knew it! I love traveling “with you.” It triggers thoughts within me. You challenge my views of the world, which makes me a better human.</p>

                  <p>I applaud you for speaking out about what happened and not accepting bullshit excuses for his behavior. The world needs more people like you. It restores my faith in humanity. Keep being you, and don't ever stop fighting for what is right. You make a difference to every person who knows you, sees your images, and reads your blog. You touch their lives for the better. I'm so happy that I have had the privilege to meet you. You have definitely touched my life. Thank you for that :)

                <p>Hi Asha,</p>
              <p>As strong as your thoughts are, they seem at odds with what one would expect given your cultural background and where you grew up. It’s a dichotomy that makes your voice even more interesting. There is no female passivity with you.</p>
              <p>I value that you have a very strong poignant voice; and you always back it up. You are a good example and role model. I would like to be more like you. I would like to speak my mind more and be more candid like you.

            <p>Asha, </p>
            <p>You choose very interesting topics and you don’t shy away from them. I admire you for that. It always makes me go Hhhmmm. And then I think – Do I want to do something about this? </p>
            <p>When we went to the restaurant, you shared passionately about the impact plastics are having on our oceans and wildlife while respecting my choice to use a straw. However, since then, I’ve been noticing more articles about plastics online and have been rethinking my use of straws. </p>

            <p>Asha, What wonderful things to read! The part about having freedom to be yourself, really resonated with me. I am working on extending the thought to let people around me be who they need to be and not try to control them or be judgmental. I remember you fondly and am so happy to see that you are happy. Sending love,</p>

            <p>Hi Asha,</p>          <p>Just got your email/newsletter.  Wow - I have to tell you, you’re the most ballsy, authentic, soul-seeking personality I think I’ve ever met.  You’re fearless, girl!  Honestly, I read your “stuff” with interest and a little bit of fear.  I think it’s because you call people out on life and choices and it makes us think!  I applaud you.  “When we go to our limits, our limits expand”, and when I get a dose of you and your writing, my limits go in all sorts of twizted directions. </p>          <p>Well, gotta run for now. </p>          <p>XO - Cheers!</p>

            <p>Hallo Asha,</p>
          <p>Wow! Wow again! Usually I don’t care too much about pictures. I prefer my mental, personal photomap. But your "Uganda-album"... it really touched me!!! The human like emotions on the great apes, the hand on the bars, and the million things YOU see (but actually don’t see) every day: a man a woman, a vern, a goat or a rooster. You made them come alive!!!
          Thanks for sharing sister!</p>
