<p>In light of Robin Williams death, it has stirred up a lot of pain within me. It has taken me back down memory lane of my own past dark times. And I've had a few in my life so far including when I left home (Muscat, Oman) to study in London at the tender age of 15, my divorce and a few others in what seems like fairly recent times. When I look at my own Facebook posts from the years that were tough for me, I can't seem to recognize myself. I see someone happy, smiling all the time and living life. And yet, outside of those fleeting moments worthy of posting on Facebook, there was such deep anguish and pain inside. What you see, is not always the reality.</p>

I've been told many times by many people that "I have it so together." I appreciate the compliment, but trust me ...
 I've broken down a few times in my life ...
 lowest of lows and agonizing pain like fish out of water. I know the feeling of seemingly have it all, and yet, not having anything and feeling so alone in this big bad world. From the outside, you look so normal. And yet, from the inside it feels like you are screaming at the top of your lungs, and yet, no one in this entire world can hear you.

I will never forget this particular moment in my life â€“ On my birthday, I confided to one of my best friend that I did not want to be here on this planet anymore. I was in a really, really bad place. He gave me a hug and walked away after letting me know that he needed to go home to attend to his laundry. As soon as he got in his car he texted me saying that he wanted me to know how much he cared for me and loved me.

The truth is, when he was presented with the opportunity to show me how much he really cared and loved me, he chose to run away. He ran away from me when I needed him the most. All I needed was someone to be with me, listen to me and share some words of wisdom or encouragement. All I needed was a hug that was forever, to let me sense and feel that I was loved. And that my existence mattered to someone. Instead, he chose to run away and texted me words of emptiness.

It's easy to say in hindsight how much we love and care about someone. If they only knew! And yet, when we have the time to show our love before they meet death, we take every opportunity to knock them down, criticize, say hurtful things, not be there for them, not take the time to truly listen and understand what they are feeling and why. We are judgmental about their thoughts and feelings because we don't understand them and neither do we want to take the time to understand.  We are busy and self-involved. And even after someone takes their own life, our judgments continue. We then accuse them of being selfish.

Having endured just a pinch of the pain that Robin Williams and many others that have committed suicide have gone through, I can't stop asking these questions ...
 Why are we so mean to each other? Why is it so hard to be supportive of each other? Why are we so judgmental? Why do we not take the time to listen and truly be there for each other? Why do we not care about the pain that we bestow upon others, to the point where we drive some of them to take the ultimate plunge? Why?
