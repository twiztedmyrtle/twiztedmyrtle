<p>To continue our conversation inspired by [Robin Williams](/posts/robin-williams-and-depression.html) death and the story I shared ...</p>


There's a school of thought that responds to depression as such – "You don't need anyone else. All you need is you. You need to love yourself and not wait for someone to love you to make you happy." I wholeheartedly agree with this philosophy for people that are not suffering from depression. However, you are not yourself when you are in depression. Your outlook on life, people and the world we live in is entirely different and not a healthy one. You don't care about anything or yourself, and are lost in a sea of darkness. So to suggest this thought to someone in depression or contemplating suicide is suicidal. They may interpret this sentiment as being judgmental, possibly condescending and that you don't understand their plight. And they will retreat within again.

I understand what this school of thought is trying to say. So let's bring some clarity. Football players have coaches who guide them and show them the way. The coach can only teach. It's up to the player to show up for practice and perform. Similarly, people suffering from depression need a lending and compassionate ear. They need support, encouragement, love and guidance. They can't do it alone. And neither can the football players. The journey of fighting the battle is yours alone. But we all need the right equipment and guidance along the way.

When a person suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts chooses to share their deepest darkest thoughts with you, it's important for us to understand how difficult that step is for them. They probably stopped themselves several times in the past before they finally, and hesitantly, decided to open up and let you in. They are trusting you with something very delicate and fragile – their emotions. We should handle it with care.

For the school of thought that believe people that commit suicide are selfish ...
 I think of the child that committed suicide because he was unable to bear any further pain from the relentless bullying at school every day. He may have tried to speak up and ask for help. But no one really took him seriously. No one came to his rescue. He didn't tell his family because he didn't want to worry them. But there were many signs along the way. Do you think this kid was selfish? Or do you think WE were selfish to not make time, not listen and not stand up for him?

We accuse victims of suicide of being selfish because we, the survivors, cannot endure the pain of their death and that we failed them. So we resort to what we know best ...
 we call them names. But have we taken a moment to think about how much pain, desperation and loneliness they must have felt to reach a point where death seemed like a better option than being alive? Pulling the plug on yourself is not an easy task; it's final. This was the only way they felt that they could finally be heard! You can see and feel the gut wrenching pain in the first and third picture of Robin Williams. It's agonizing.

The gentleman I referenced in my story is not a bad guy or a villain. He is a good guy who was unable to deal with his own fears when I uttered some scary thoughts to him. I can relate to this as I had failed to be a good friend to someone else in my past. My friend had cancer and I failed him miserably; I was immature and too busy trying to deal with my own turmoil. I also didn't know what to say to him; I was uncomfortable and ill-equipped. Sometimes the timing is off for our maturity level and certain incidents that present themselves in front of us. But hopefully we learn, grow and are able to help in the future.

I have come to learn that we go through our own difficult times so that we can help others in the future that may be going through something similar. As a result, we can empathize and relate. We can connect. We can make them laugh. We can help and support them. And hopefully we can see them climb out of that dark hole and be happy again.

Thank you to all of you that took the time to share your sentiments, send supportive and beautiful emails and even worried phone calls checking up on me. I am in a beautiful place in my life; nothing to worry. And a special thanks to those that chose and had the courage to share their own personal struggles on the [chitchat page](/blog.html), <a href="https://www.facebook.com/twiztedmyrtle" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or LinkedIn, or emailed me personally. Thank you, deeply.
