The <a href="http://www.johngray-seacanoe.com/index.php" target="_blank">John Gray Sea Canoe</a> tour in Phuket, Thailand, took me by surprise. I expected to see some cool sea caves, hundreds of bats huddled at the top of the cave ceilings, enjoy a little kayaking, appreciate nature's beauty , take a few photos to remember the day and head back to the hotel. While all that came true, we experienced something so much more magical than that.

During our boat ride to Phang Nga, one couldn't help but be in awe of the spectacular and pure beauty of the islands. I was convinced for a moment that the creators of the movie Avatar were inspired by Thailand. It felt as though they simply replicated this picturesque landscape of hundreds of islands; the only difference being, they suspended these islands in air.

</div>As we kayaked our way into the dark sea caves and came out the other end, we found ourselves out in the open again surrounded by mountains in a circle. While restrictive, it was also liberating. It felt like we just entered into an entirely different world, similar to what we see in movies like Thor. The silence was magical and overwhelming; one that I have never heard or experienced before.

After exploring 3 caves, it was time for dinner. What made this so special is that our guides made us feel like as if we were guests invited to their home. We were not just another group of tourists and this was not just another day they needed to get through. Instead, they were present in the moment with us. Their care and genuine efforts were reflective in the hearty meal the cooks had prepared for us on board. This was a home cooked meal and it was absolutely yummy delicious!

</div>During sunset time, our guides taught us how to make our own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_Krathong" target="_blank">Kratong</a>, decorated with orchids and candles in creative ways. While making this beautiful Kratong, we noticed that we were alone in the waters. Not a soul to be seen or heard for as far as the eyes could see. We were the only ones there to selfishly appreciate and enjoy all of nature's beauty.

Darkness arrived. And we headed into the sea cave one last time. We could not see much, except for small glimmers of light coming from the head torches attached to our guides. We lit our Kratong and offered it to the ocean while making beautiful wishes. It was the most pure, spiritual, magical and romantic experience that nothing else compares to!

Beautiful experience in every way you can imagine. If you visit Phuket, book your John Gray Sea Canoe Tour experience. Don't even think about it. Just do it ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png) .

PS â€“ The guides' sense of humor made the trip even more memorable. They are switched on and they had us in stitches!
