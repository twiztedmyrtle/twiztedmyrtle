<p>It's 2 am and the taxi is waiting for us. My relatives and I start our journey from [Rajkot](http://twiztedmyrtle.photoshelter.com/gallery-collection/View-Gallery/C0000qSXIepKx7lw) to Gir National Forest, Gujarat, India. We made it there by 5:30am. Phew! A sigh of relief because I wanted to catch the very first morning tour  to take some cool shots of the Asiatic Lions against the background of the beautiful morning sunrays.</p>

We got in line to get our tickets and were brimming with excitement. Counter closed! What just happened? Found out we missed the first tour by 4 people in front of us. So we were now supposed to wait in line until the counter reopened (minimum 1.5 hours, but who knows). I didn't quite understand why they couldn't just give us the tickets for the 2<sup>nd</sup> tour so we were not prisoners in that queue for an unknown period of time.

Okay. Shit happens. So as I came to terms with the long wait, my little noggin started to identify the issues with this experience from a business and customer service perspective and how to solve them. I was positive Walt Disney was with me on this one. Shout out to Gir National Forest ...
 happy to share solutions at no cost. My way of giving back to the state in which I was born. Nothing but love for you ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png) .

As I waited for an agonizing five long minutes, I saw the sun rising. I could not pass up on this opportunity. This is why we drove for 3+ hours! I bolted from the queue and ran over to our taxi. I knocked on the car like my life depended on it and with an intense sense of urgency. The driver had just got himself comfortable and he was ready for a nice nap. Ooops! Yes, crazy is in the house ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png) . Let's go and get a move on fast! Take me somewhere. Take me anywhere where I can see the sun rising.

I kid you not. He drove out of the complex, took the very first left turn, drove for 20 seconds and just stopped the car in the middle of nowhere. Here you go missy was basically his message. Here I go where? There was no vantage point, no view, no nothing. I did not have the patience to have a chat with him. So I took off with my cousin, on foot, looking for something interesting to shoot as I saw the sun rising faster than I could breathe. As we took a few steps we saw railroad tracks. We followed it and within minutes, my cousin screamed "peacocks, peacocks, peacocks!"

We chased the peacocks and got some shots. And then, from nowhere, we saw a family of monkeys at the train station, crossing the railroad tracks. Aaaah, I was in heaven. I couldn't believe it. We got to see the monkeys and peacocks, in the wild and against the soft and gentle morning rays. No admission fees necessary. Just an explorer's heart needed.

The most interesting part of this day was that after paying and roaming around the national forest for several hours, we did not see any lions. Not one! The inside whispers were that this was all a scam. Apparently the guides predetermine which groups get to see the lions and they know where the lions are as they have GPS on them. Oh, and they may be sedated. So if you were in one of the groups that was predetermined to not see the lions, then the only way to possibly see them was to bribe the tour guide. I cannot confirm any of this ...
 except, bribery is a common practice in India so that part does not require any further validation. The rest was hearsay. However, I can further confirm that my particular guide was crude, full of shit and I certainly felt like they were running a scam.

Impatience can be a virtue. The itch to not miss the moment and desire to explore led to us running into some beautiful peacocks and a family of monkeys. Had it not been for that moment, I would have come back home empty handed with no photos to share as we never got to see any lions. But I was content. While the moment lasted only a few minutes, the entire journey was worth it to experience those few precious minutes. The beauty of that moment was in the unexpected gifts that appeared in front of us.
