After capturing the peacock shot at Aji Dam (see "[Why so special?](/posts/why-so-special.html), we weren't ready to go home just yet. We drove around the city as it was slowly waking up and to see what else we could stumble upon.

This photograph is one of my favorite shots. As we were driving, I saw this mini truck with 4 kids and their mother, I assume, enjoying their open air and most luxurious ride. I was drawn to them. I asked my cousin to speed up and get me as close to them as possible.

I took a few shots before they realized what I was doing. If you see the photo just before this one in the [Rajkot album](http://twiztedmyrtle.photoshelter.com/gallery-collection/View-Gallery/C0000qSXIepKx7lw) ...
 that was the first moment when they realized that I was taking their picture. You can see their innocent excitement in that shot which is beautiful. This particular shot came shortly thereafter; I love how happy the mother is as she looks at her younger son and his excitment. The even more beautiful part is how the older son doesn't care about me anymore. Instead, he is looking at his Mom and is happy to see her happy.

This shot was taken as both our vehicles were in motion on the freeway. I am still amazed that I captured this shot with such clarity. Perhaps it was beginner's luck ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png)

This moment, their pure joy for each other and the interaction they had with me after they realized I was taking their photo was quite something. I will never forget that feeling. We never said anything to each other. Just exchanged big, fat hearty smiles. I felt fulfilled that in some small way I made their day and made them smile. For me, they were certainly the highlight of my day. Their innocence and joy from the simplest things in life made them rich in my eyes.

PS â€“ I can't end this story without making mention of the youngest kid. He looks like such a cutie patootie!
