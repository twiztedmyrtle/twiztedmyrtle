<p>This is India ...
Vivid, colorful, historically rich, incredible architecture, vivacious, full of life and energy, majestic, deeply contrasting, sensory overload, heart breaking poverty, mind blowing wealth, beautiful, dirty, luxurious, full of heart  and yet so heartless ...</p>


India is not your typical vacation spot. Perhaps it's best described as "an experience," and one that I would highly recommend. During my trip to India in 2012, I visited <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Mumbai" target="_blank">Mumbai, Maharashtra</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkot" target="_blank">Rajkot, Gujarat</a>. I wrote short blurbs of what I experienced as it happened during my trip. Here's my mixed bag of uncensored journal entries â€“

You know you're in India when you have to ask or verify the presence of toilet rolls before you walk into a toilet (restrooms)

Today ...
missing what Phoenix calls air pollution. I will take that any day.

You know you're in India when everyone honks and everyone casually ignores it.

You know you're in India when you sit in a vacant spot and can smell BO from the last person who sat there.

Saw gorgeous sunset in Bandra, Mumbai, with hopeless romantics everywhere. Beautiful!

You know you're in India when your shopping experience goes like this ...
Everyone is there to please you, extremely hospitable, order juices/sandwiches/anything you want while you shop. Shop like a Queen!

This was a new & rare experience for me ...
Restaurant had 3 floors. I got seated on the top floor ...
Smelled like piss. Bathrooms are on the floor below. How is this possible? WTF? And yes, I walked out.

Juhu beach was awesome today ...
Kala Khatta Gola, gorgeous sunset, lots of photos of strangers/volunteers which was innocently charming and loved catching strangers in "moments."

Blown away by how gorgeous and breathtaking the Taj hotel is. Absolutely stunning and classy.

Watching folks drive in India is like watching a dance between cars, trucks, rickshaws, bicyclists, cows, dogs, people and more. In all the chaos, it all just magically fits and seamlessly works. It's mesmerizing!

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">You know you're in India when you would pay handsomely for 2 puffs of industrial strength Febreze. I got stuck in a 45 minute cab ride smelling BO. On a positive note, learned gag reflexes are in good working order  ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png)</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">You know you're in India when you are served with finger bowls after dinner. Warm water and lemon to squeeze to wash your hands after a hearty meal. Feels good.  Aaaahhhh!</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">RK and Elco (awesome and must visit these restaurants in Andheri and Bandra, respectively) ...
Very cool to see how your business has grown over the years. Congrats! Confession ...
Elco, I miss the old hole in the wall charm and vibe of your restaurant/rekdi.</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">It's been heartwarming to meet and catch up with childhood friends I haven't seen for over 8 years!</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">You know you're in India when the milkman, grocery guy and laundry guy all come to your home for pick up/drop off and not the other way around. Good stuff! Oh the luxury and convenience!</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">You know you're in India when you wonder if you took a shower after you took a shower.</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">Got reminded what it's like to be a 5 yr old when relatives pulled my cheeks because they were so excited to see me. I suppose you always are the little girl and never grow up in the eyes of your relatives. It's reflective of their innocence and simplicity which is very beautiful.</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">You know you're in India when you think smoking may be a healthier option for your lungs than the air you breathe.</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">Fresh Sugar Cane juice!!! Been craving it for 2 years. Aaaaahhhh!</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">Ok ...
Seen a few too many men facing the wall. No more, please. (Reference to public urination)</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">You know you're in India when the trash can is just a drop away from your hand. At Disney, it's 25 steps away. I think India's got Disney beat!</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">It's nice to talk in Hindi again!</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">Thank you Bombay & Rajkot for an awesome time. I will miss the warm welcome of relatives, spirit of the people, kala khatta golas at Juhu beach, vimto soda, fresh lime soda, elco's pani puri, rekdi food, cutting masala chai, exotic fresh fruits and fruit juices, beautiful trees & flowers, gorgeous big plumeira's, chasing peacocks, spectacular sunsets, incredible architecture and palaces, being inspired to take pictures, sight of hopeless romantics, the sweet and heavenly smell of mogra's (Jasmine) ...
</span>

<span style=\"color: #333333;\">Having said all that, after 3 weeks in India, all I can think of is ...
exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate. And what spa can I camp out at for my oesophagus back home? I have never tasted & eaten so much dirt involuntarily before.</span>
