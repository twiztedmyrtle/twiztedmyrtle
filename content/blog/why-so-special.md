<p>While this may not be the sharpest photo in my collection, it is very dear to me because of what it signifies for my journey in photography. Here's the back story ...</p>


Two of my cousins in Rajkot, India, entertained my madness by actually waking up super early in the morning to take me to Aji Dam for some cool sunrise shots. Pitch black and off we went. The roads were clear, silent and peaceful. It was a crisp and refreshing morning.

We got there and I wasn't too impressed. But perhaps the sunrise will make up for it all. The skies had been extremely hazy for the past 3 days and you just couldn't see clearly. We waited for a while hoping the film of haze would disappear soon. That did not happen.

Disappointed, we got in the car to head back. We hardly drove 25ft and suddenly, from nowhere, I see a beautiful peacock about 70ft away to my left. I was stunned, childlike excited and in disbelief. I screamed out to my cousin ...
 stop, stop, stop! The poor kid screeched to a halt as fast as he could.

I bolted out of the car and started taking pictures. The closer I got, the faster the peacock ran away from me. Smart peacock :). I had a split second moment where I knew it's now or never. I stood still and took my shots as I saw the peacock fly away in a hurry. It was gone, just like that.

As we walked back to the car, I wanted to see what I may have captured. I didn't have much hope because the peacock was fast and I was a beginner's beginner photographer at the time. As I sifted through the spoils, I saw this shot! The peacock in flight and wings spread out to appreciate it's beauty, colors and grace. Oh my goodness! I got "the" shot. My cousins and I jumped up and down like 2 year olds with pure excitement and disbelief!

And that was the moment. That was the moment when I knew I wanted to get deeper into photography. It was the disappointment, unexpected gift and exhilaration of capturing that split second in time or it's forever gone. That's thrilling. And the best part was that I shared that moment and emotions with my cousins. It was magical.
