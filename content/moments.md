      <h1>Michael Luna</h1>
      <h2>Professional Photographer</h2>
      <p>Insightful and wildly gifted with a true world heart, Asha is a rare talent and true compassionate freethinker. Her body of work is both striking and rare, and other times thought provoking to our social consciousness. I feel deeply fortunate to have met her through an unlikely encounter.</p>

      <h1>Twizted Asha</h1>

      <p style="margin-top: 6rem;">When was the last time you read a rotten testimonial? Take your time. I’ve got all day.</p>

      <h1>Casey Kern</h1>
      <h2>Senior Action Team Coordinator, PETA</h2>
      <p>Asha is truly an explorer of the mind and globe. Her blogs and podcasts hit listeners with a “wake up!” message as she explores shrouded topics from the dark animal skins trade to the invisible scars that we all carry. Her work is always meaningful!</p>

      <h1>Paul Mulligan</h1>
      <h2>President & CEO, Catholic Charities</h2>
      <p>Asha is truly a force to be reckoned with! Her fearlessness in standing up for those who have no voice makes her both one to watch and learn from. Her tremendous energy and enthusiasm reflect her passion for life, truth and justice.</p>

      <h1>Eric Snelz</h1>
      <h2>CEO, Helping Hands for Freedom</h2>
      <p>Asha’s photography doesn’t confine itself to one genre. It can be both pleasing to the eye and soul, while other times evoking a visceral reaction to the human condition. Be prepared to have either your imagination or intellect exposed to a unique perspective on life.</p>

      <h1>Norbert Rosing</h1>
      <h2>Professional Wildlife Photographer</h2>
      <p>I worked closely with Asha in Spitsbergen. She has a very artistic photographic eye and is able to pick a piece of art from a regular subject. Her way of communicating with people and talent for photography makes her an extraordinary person to work with and be around.</p>

      <p>Asha has a keen eye. She has the ability to see the smallest of details and bring their story to the forefront. She connects with her subjects intimately and captures their essence perfectly. Her photography is compelling!</p>
