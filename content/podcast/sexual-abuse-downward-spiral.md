<p>Meet Sara. It would be fair to say that she's been through hell and back. Sara sheds light on how her perpetrator groomed her for one year to become a victim of sexual abuse. How did he get in her mind? What drove her to cut her body with a razor and become addicted to it? How did she get introduced to drugs?</p>

Her reasons were profound! She left me speechless.
